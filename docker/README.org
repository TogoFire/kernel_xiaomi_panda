* About

A repository that contains a kconfig to enable docker support in android kernels

* Usage

** If you are using SLMK, you don't need these configs

=CONFIG_MEMCG=

=CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP=

** You can add this to your tree by doing these commands

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git fetch https://github.com/cyberknight777/android_kernel_docker main
git merge -s ours --no-commit --allow-unrelated-histories --squash FETCH_HEAD
git read-tree --prefix=docker -u FETCH_HEAD
git commit -m "Imported docker/ from https://github.com/cyberknight777/android_kernel_docker"
#+END_SRC

** Then go to arch/yourtargetarchitecture/Kconfig and add this line below:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell   
source "docker/Kconfig"
#+END_SRC

** Next you would need to enable all the options in Utilities except for this one(if you use SLMK):

=CONFIG_DOCKER_SWAP=

** Once that's done feel free to compile and use your kernel which has docker enabled now :)

Tested on Kernels 4.14, 4.4, and 4.9
